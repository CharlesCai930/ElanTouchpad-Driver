ElanTech Touchpad Driver for Mac OSX


This is the driver implementation for the Elan Touchpad to Mac OSX based on the source code of the Linux(arjan opmeer) and ideas from the VoodooPS2 & Apple Sources. For now, it is working only with the V3 Hardware of Elan Touchpad which I have in my Asus Notebook. Most of the code has been hard coded to the packet format of the V3 Hardware.


Features working in my driver:

* Works as Normal Mouse
* Single, Two and Three Finger Tapping
* Corner Tapping
* Two Finger Zoom and Rotations
  Pinch Zoom
  Circular and Arc Rotations
* Three Finger Swipe
* Scrolling
  Two Finger - Horizontal and Vertical Scrolling
  one Finger - Edge Scrolling with Circular
* Two and Three Finger Double/Tripe taps for enabling/disabling features
* Two and Three Finger Press
* Dragging
  Tap to drag with Finger tap release
  Single Finger Hold Drag like we do in normal mouse
* Ignoring Accidental Input with little Palm Checking
* Using Mouse button to Enable/Disable the touchpad
